    "# Unit 14 Homework: Belly Button Biodiversity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json` from the URL `https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![bar Chart](Images/hw01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use `otu_ids` for the x values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use `sample_values` for the y values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use `sample_values` for the marker size.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use `otu_labels` for the text values.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bubble Chart](Images/bubble_chart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "![hw](Images/hw03.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard. An example dashboard is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![hw](Images/hw02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo. Ensure that your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following task is advanced and therefore optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adapt the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will need to modify the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Weekly Washing Frequency Gauge](Images/gauge.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `console.log` inside of your JavaScript code to see what your data looks like at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Refer to the [Plotly.js documentation](https://plot.ly/javascript/) when building the plots.\n",
